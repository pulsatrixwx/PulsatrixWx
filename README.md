PulsatrixWx
===========

PulsatrixWx produces professional-quality weather graphics in large batches with the magic of Python and Matplotlib. The software allows users to write simple scripts to load data from a variety of common meteorological formats, format the data into the appropriate variables and units, and produce professional plots quickly. This software is the public fork of the HootPy software package from the Oklahoma Weather Lab. Maps of model and observed data are currently supported, and we hope to add vertical profiles, cross-sections, and meteograms. We welcome anyone who would like to collaborate with us. Please email David John Gagne (djgagne at ou dot edu) or Tim Supinie (tsupinie at ou dot edu) if you are interested. 

Requirements
============

PulsatrixWx requires a recent version of Python 2 (Python 2.7 preferred). The following libraries are required: Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy. For reading netCDF files, netCDF4-python or PyNIO is encouraged, and PyNIO is required for reading grib files. PulsatrixWx works directly with the Anaconda or Enthought Python distributions.
